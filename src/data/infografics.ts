About Children of the 90s 

Based at the University of Bristol, Children of the 90s, also known as the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), is a long-term health research project that enrolled more than 14,000 pregnant women in 1991 and 1992.  It has been following the health and development of the parents, their children and now their grandchildren in detail ever since. It receives core funding from the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust and the University of Bristol.`,

    description: `During growth from childhood (9 years) to young adulthood (24 years), body fat mass tripled as children gained weight. However, this increase in body fat was not associated with signs of subclinical atherosclerosis progression likely due to the significant increase in muscle mass. A muscle mass-to-fat mass ratio of 4:1 (MM4-FM1) may promote excellent vascular health from childhood. Image: Andrew Agbaje.`,
